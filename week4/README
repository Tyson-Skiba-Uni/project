Program has Two Run Options

To run in either mode execute the program found in the source directory

if run with no command line options the program will continute to run until End of File is entered, CTRL+D is presed or CTRL+C is pressed

To run in counter mode add argument --count or -c and the number of inputs.

Example: 

/program/src/llist -c 2

This will execute the program with a count value of 2
